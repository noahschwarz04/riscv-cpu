# riscv-cpu
This project implements a 32-bit RISC-V CPU (RV32I subset) from scratch in Verilog HDL. The design follows a modular architecture and supports instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back stages.

The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with computer architecture, digital logic design, and hardware description languages by building a working processor that can run assembly-level RISC-V programs.
